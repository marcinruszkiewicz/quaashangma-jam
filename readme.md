# Quaashangma

A remnant of the Hundred Year Demon War. The outside fortress is mostly in ruins now, except for the camp the Adventurers Guild set up to support exploration of the dungeon.

When the Heroes destroyed the Demon General Raxhelis' castle during their long and bloody battle with her, for many years before that Quaashanga served as a base for the Demons, so its extensive dungeon is still there below the ground, filled with traps, monsters and treasure. How extensive? Nobody knows.

That's why you're here.

# Dungeon Exploration

As a new Adventurer, you have come to the Quaashangma fortress site to explore it, kill monsters and find treasure. You're obviously not the first one to came up with this idea, but worry not - the unique construction of this dungeon makes it sure there's enough of both monsters and treasure for every Adventurer that wants to try.

This dungeon is unlike any other built before or after it - it's believed to be endless, or pretty much close enough to it. Once you enter through one of the gateways, it's very unlikely that you're going to go through the same rooms you visited before. It's not impossible - some Adventurers have tried marking the rooms and eventually they found the ones they've marked - but there's apparently enough of the rooms down there that you shouldn't expect to see the same ones ever again.

Because of this, the Adventurers Guild outfits every one going in with a special Return Crystal. You can use it between dungeon floors to exit the dungeon with your loot, and it will even automatically teleport you back outside if the monsters overwhelm you - though your loot is not guaranteed to come back with you in such a case. Still, loot is a small price to pay when the alternative is getting injured with no chance of getting rescued before you bleed out to death or the Demons turn you into a fresh meal.

# Jam Version?

This is a version done in about a week (including installing Haxe and figuring out how to do anything in it) for the [HaxeJam 2023: Winter Jam](https://itch.io/jam/haxejam-2023-winter-jam). Due to time constraints (and my regular day job during the week) it's not very advanced. I will be updating the game in the future, as I find the idea pretty entertaining and worth expanding on.

You can see the sources on my [Github](https://github.com/marcinruszkiewicz/quaashangma-jam).
